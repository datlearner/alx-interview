0x09. Island Perimeter
Algorithm
Python
Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

grid is a list of list of integers:
0 represents water
1 represents land
Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
The grid is completely surrounded by water
There is only one island (or nothing).
The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).


Concepts Needed:
2D Arrays (Matrices):

Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
Conditional Logic:

Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
Counting Techniques:

Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.
Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
Python Programming:

Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be equipped to approach the problem methodically. You’ll need to iterate over the grid, apply logical operations to identify the perimeter of the island, and account for the specific conditions described in the task. This project not only tests your algorithmic thinking but also reinforces your ability to manipulate data structures and apply logical reasoning to solve problems.
